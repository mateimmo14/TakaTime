# ⏳ TakaTime (VS Code Edition)

**A privacy-first, serverless time tracker for your GitHub Profile.**

TakaTime is a lightweight alternative to WakaTime that requires **no monthly fees** and **no external servers**. It tracks your coding activity directly from VS Code and saves it to your own free MongoDB Atlas cluster.

## 🚀 Features

- **Privacy-First:** You own your data. No third-party analytics.
- **Auto-Sync:** Updates your GitHub Profile README with your latest stats.
- **Language Tracking:** Automatically detects languages (Python, Go, JS, etc.) and projects.

## 📦 Installation

1.  Install this extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2.  Open VS Code. The extension will automatically check for the necessary binary.

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get a Database

1.  Create a free account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
2.  Create a new Cluster (Free Tier).
3.  Go to **Database Access** -> Add a new user (keep the password safe!).
4.  Go to **Network Access** -> Allow access from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
5.  Click **Connect** -> **Drivers** -> Copy the connection string (e.g., `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0...`).

### Step 2: Configure Extension

2.  Run the command: `TakaTime: Setup MongoDB URI`.
3.  Paste your connection string and hit Enter.

## 🔧 Commands

- `TakaTime: Setup MongoDB URI`: Opens the configuration prompt to update your database connection or re-download the binary.

## 📊 How to Display Stats on GitHub

To show the graph on your GitHub profile, you need to set up the **Taka-Report** action in your profile repository.

1.  Go to your GitHub Profile repository (`username/username`).
2.  Create a file: `.github/workflows/takatime.yml`.
3.  Copy the workflow configuration from the [Official Repository](https://github.com/Rtarun3606k/TakaTime).

## 🛡️ Privacy Policy

**TakaTime does not send your data to any third-party servers.**

- Your coding activity is sent **only** to the MongoDB URI you provide.
- The extension downloads a helper binary from the official [TakaTime GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Rtarun3606k/TakaTime/releases).
- No telemetry is collected by the extension author.
